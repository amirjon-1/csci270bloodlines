## Bloodlines

The assignment description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r315RI4HrGn_lHxQ0lV1yRx49AyMThAPbZtxbQR0qKo/edit?usp=sharing).

This repository contains starter code:
- `factor.py`: Code for questions one, two, and three goes in this file
- `bayes.py`: Code for question four and five goes in this file
- `genetics.py`: Code for questions six, seven, eight, nine, and ten goes in this file

It also contains code that you can use and/or emulate but should not change:
- `montyhall.py`: The Monty Hall Bayesian network discussed in class.
- `vampire.py`: The blood types Bayesian network discussed in class.
- `util.py`: Contains the utility function `compute_elimination_order`. You do not have to understand how this function works.

Finally it contains the visualizer:
- `bloodlines.py`: Run this from the command-line once you've completed questions one through ten.

Ignore (but do not delete!!!) the other files in this repository.
